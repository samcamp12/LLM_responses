 you will 
select a few user stories to work through that will showcase your domain experience
and operational excellence. 
Could you give me some examples?


- Enable project renaming and description editing in `pages.ProjectDetail` with persistence via `services.updateProject`; include validation and success/error UX.  
- Surface inspiration metadata (title, screenshot, notes) by wiring `utils.getMetadata` into the project detail view, caching results in IndexedDB, and showing loading/error states.  
- Harden navigation by adding route-driven active styling tests for `components.DesktopNavigation` using React Testing Library and ensuring accessibility attributes remain correct.  
- Introduce IndexedDB error telemetry by wrapping `utils.indexedDB` calls with failure reporting, plus unit tests that simulate corrupted stores.
